VanillaBootstrap
================

#### A modern Vanilla theme based on Bootstrap from Twitter

This branch contains the latest build of the VanillaBootstrap theme. If you want your theme to be completely up to date be sure to check in on a regular basis and download the latest source code.

Documentation can be found here: https://github.com/kasperisager/VanillaBootstrap/tree/v1.0b-2.0

#### Versioning

I'm using a rather simple versioning system that looks like this: `[major].[minor][state]-[vanilla]` where `[vanilla]` indicates which branch of Vanilla the theme is compatible with.
