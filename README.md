VanillaBootstrap
================

#### A modern Vanilla theme based on Bootstrap from Twitter

This branch contains the alpha release of the VanillaBootstrap theme. I advice you to use v1.1b-2.0 instead though, as this build isn't optimized for use in a production evironment. A better version is currently in the making, you can follow the development in the `development` branch.

#### Versioning

I'm using a rather simple versioning system that looks like this: `[major].[minor][state]-[vanilla]` where `[vanilla]` indicates which branch of Vanilla the theme is compatible with.
